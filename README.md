In this Repo i'll be uploading all my projects, this should take 7-10 months to complete. Learn by building.


# Project Title

Intercalated Challenges: Software Engineering + GameDev

# Initial Challenge: To-Do List (Basic CRUD)
    Objective: Create a simple task management app that allows adding, editing, removing, and listing tasks.

    Suggested Technologies: JavaScript (Frontend) + Node.js/Express or Python Flask (Backend).

    Description:

        Implement basic CRUD logic (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

        Store tasks in a simple database like MongoDB or SQLite.

        Create a simple HTML/CSS interface with the ability to mark tasks as completed.

# Initial Challenge: Guessing Game in Console
    Objective: Create a simple guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number.

    Suggested Technologies: Python or JavaScript.

    Description:

        The computer generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it.

        The game should give hints if the guess is higher or lower than the correct number.

        Implement a trial counter and a victory system.

# Intermediate Challenge: Blog with Authentication System
    Objective: Create a simple blog where users can register, log in, and post articles.

    Suggested Technologies: React (Frontend) + Node.js/Express or Django (Backend).

    Description:

        Implement a login and registration system with user authentication.

        Create pages to view, edit, and delete posts.

        Use a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to persist data.

        Implement input validation (e.g., title and content of posts) and password security (using bcrypt).

# Intermediate Challenge: 2D Platformer Game (Mario-like)
    Objective: Create a simple platformer where the character can run, jump, and collect items.

    Suggested Technologies: Unity or Godot.

    Description:

        Implement a character that can move left, right, and jump.

        Create a 2D world with platforms and obstacles.

        The player must collect items or points while avoiding obstacles.

        Add a score system that increases as the player collects items.

# Advanced Challenge: Movie/Product Recommendation System
    Objective: Create a simple recommendation system that suggests movies or products based on the user's history.

    Suggested Technologies: Python (Flask/Django) + Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

    Description:

        Use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies or products.

        Work with real datasets of movies (e.g., IMDB) or products (e.g., Amazon).

        Implement a rating system where users can rate movies or products.

# Advanced Challenge: 2D Fighting Game with AI
    Objective: Create a 2D fighting game with characters that can attack, defend, and an opponent controlled by AI.

    Suggested Technologies: Unity or Godot.

    Description:

        Implement fighting mechanics (attacks, defense, combos).

        Create animations for attacks and character reactions.

        Develop basic AI for the enemy with attack and defense patterns.

        Add a HUD (Heads-Up Display) to show the health and score.

# Advanced Challenge: Full E-commerce System
    Objective: Create a complete e-commerce platform with product catalogs, a shopping cart, and checkout functionalities.

    Suggested Technologies: React (Frontend) + Node.js/Express or Django (Backend).

    Description:

        Build an online store with product categories and search options.

        Implement a shopping cart where users can add and remove products.

        Create a checkout and payment system (integrating with APIs like Stripe or PayPal).

        Add an order history screen.

# Final Challenge: Racing Game with AI Opponents
    Objective: Create a racing game where the player competes against AI-controlled opponents.

    Suggested Technologies: Unity or Unreal Engine.

    Description:

        Create a racing circuit with obstacles and checkpoints.

        The player must control a car, using realistic physics for acceleration, braking, and turning.

        Develop AI for the opponents that simulates competition, with adjustable speeds and obstacles.

        Implement a scoring system based on the total time to complete the circuit.

# Master Challenge: Task Management System with Real-time Notifications
    Objective: Create a task management application with real-time notifications to update users.

    Suggested Technologies: React (Frontend) + Node.js/Express (Backend) + Socket.io.

    Description:

        Implement a real-time notification system to alert users about pending tasks or new tasks.

        Create an interface to allow users to create, edit, and complete tasks.

        Use WebSockets to send real-time notifications about task changes.

        Store data in MongoDB or PostgreSQL and sync tasks across multiple devices.

# Final Challenge: 3D Action Game with Dynamic Combat and Physics
    Objective: Create a 3D action game with dynamic combat mechanics and interactive physics.

    Suggested Technologies: Unity or Unreal Engine.

    Description:

        Implement 3D combat, with character attacks and interactive physics (e.g., pushing objects, breaking walls).

        Add fluid movements, such as running, jumping, and dodging.

        Create AI-controlled enemies with different behaviors (attack, defense, flee).

        Use 3D assets and implement realistic animations.

        Add a simple storyline and missions for the player to complete.
